LOCAL IMAGES.

there are TWO ways to do it : 

1. import the image using an import statement at the top of the page

2. use require

the first object in the list below uses the import method to import hammer.js
see how you need to add an import line to the top of the page.

the second object uses the require method.
you dont need an import statement at the top of the page.
